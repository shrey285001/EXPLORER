WHAT MAKES OUR ONLINE EXAM SYSTEM WEB PROJECT DIFFERS FROM OTHERS??

Low internet connection would be sufficient to load the pages, since we havenâ€™t used much picture data(using pictures the user with low internet connection takes time to load the images). In other online exam system websites , we can find only one admin who is surely responsible for the addition or deletion of the test, but we made this site any number of authorized persons can add/remove the examinations and these all authorized persons and users of this site will be controlled by the admin. It could be very helpful for educational institues acting as :

Admin(headdash.php) --- director of institute
Teacher(dash.php) --- professors of college
User(acccount.php) --- students of the college
home page (index.php) Security with password , continuosly monitored by teachers, even the admin cannot look at the password , ensuring the trust of the users. A feedback system available for suggesting improvements and registering complaints.
